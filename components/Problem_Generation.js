- Combine Iterative Drawing (Sycra) with Level Design ideas (GMTK).
- Procedurally generated to challenge the user's weaknesses and chunk their skills.
- Becomes more challenging over time.
- Get combined with Problems and Puzzles from other Lessons.
- A focus on either Muscle Memory or Observation or both.
  - A way to determine what people are struggling with, and get them to focus on that until they are balanced. (Sycra)

An Exercise should be able to create a Problem Set. These should be related to the progress that has been made by the student, and the problems should target their weaknesses and give them a problem that will allow them to make the Smallest Achievable Perfection (Talent Book). Use performance data from other users to predict how much progress the user can make.

The app needs to create a curriculum that's focused on the user's strengths and weaknesses. It needs to give them some kind of targeted practice that can improve the user's understanding by optimizing their Cognitive Load and to find out what information is already in their long-term memory.

I need to create files for each kind of lesson. The Exercise component will load them if they're given as a prop. This will add them to a toolbar, which lets you select the type of exercise you want to change parameters for. All parameters should be able to be modified by selecting Primitive Forms and Parameters that are on-screen.

I need a way to let users create custom exercises for themselves.

How do I create the Markmaking Exercise?
- All exercise properties need to be placed into a store.
- You need a way to specify Forms and their properties.
- You need to set a goal.
- You need a way to evaluate progress made on that goal, as well as to see your current strengths and weaknesses, and the recommended parameters for improving so that they can be used in your automatic curriculum.
- Your data visualization needs to include their strengths and weaknesses, as well as the recommended range of parameters they should aim to be in for their next automatic practice. Describe what they can consistently achieve at particular practice parameters.

Use L-Systems to generate 3D Plants that the user can try to draw.
Create plants based on the user's strengths and weaknesses.
