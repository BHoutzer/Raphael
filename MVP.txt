How do I make my MVP in one month? What would it actually need? Focus on shipping an MVP.

Because of Scope Creep, I should cut down the number of features that I'll include in the MVP.

Because of Analysis Paralysis, I should give myself a deadline so that I just have to take action.

Make the MVP your singular focus.
Factor in playtesting - at least 5 days of the month.
You don't need loads of content - just see how it works as a complete whole. MVPs are for determining if an idea works and is worth developing.
