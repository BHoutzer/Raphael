1. Structuralization:

- Learning to draw the simple shapes - cones, spheres, cylinders, boxes.
- Draw these shapes in 1, 2, or 3 point perspective.
  - Creating spatial awareness.
  - Draw these shapes intuitively.
- Draw multiple shapes together.

2. Manipulation:

- Learning to manipulate shapes (commonly overlooked).
  1. Bend/twist
  2. squish/stretch
  3. manipulate the contours (helpful for organic shapes; it means to )
  4. manipulate edges/beveling; the sort of processing you see in 3D modeling
  - Check ThreeJS to see all options
  - (sidenote: draw things being affected by gravity).
- Teach people to manipulate simple shapes and make them interesting before they move on to more complex shapes.

3. Observation:

- Breaking a complex shape into a composite of modified simple shapes.
  - Identify the shapes.
  - Identify the manipulation.

4. Education:

- Learning more about the things you want to know about.

5. Imitation:

- Copy other artists to see how they use the ideas you're familiar with.
- To cultivate your own style, you need an accumulation of ideas taken from people you look up to by imitating them.
  - Take a little bit of every person's style; the end result will be yours.

6. Imagination:

It seems like 1 and 2 depend on knowing how to Transform, Scale, and Rotate ThreeJS objects.
