Create the illusion of 3D on a 2D surface.

- Diminution: how things shrink as they move into the distance.
- 1, 2, and 3-point perspective
- Right angles.
- How blocks are made from right angles.
- Make cylinders from boxes.
- Make cross-contours, which will help you to predict how light will be reflected on an object.
- Make things that are machine-like look organic.
  - I want to place a cube on the phone, and have it draw lines to the horizon to show where the Vanishing Points would have to be in order for that cube to be in perspective. Make people imagine that they carry their horizon lines. In fact, teach students that a painting with complex perspective will have multiple objects with their own perspectives, many of which won't be aligned with one another. Simple perspective has shared Vanishing Points that all objects are aligned with, and complex perspective has Vanishing Points unique to each object.

Create a Perspective script with a Horizon Line and the option to place Vanishing Points.
All Forms have to draw their lines toward these Vanishing Points.

Variables:

1. Horizon Line - a straight horizontal line.
2. Eye Level

Functions:

1. Draw Line - this should be placed within another function.
