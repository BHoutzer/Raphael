Once you're in Move(), you already have two values to work with, so you should be able to perform all functions needed for calculating the Speed and Angle of the line.

It isn't the angle between points that matters; it's the difference in sequential angles that matters. The most important of this is the first Angle; or, at least, the first wrong angle to be made. You also need to categorize the different kinds of angles.

Angles:

1. Small, time-dependent angle errors: Caused by slow drawing speed. Improved by drawing the line faster.
2. Large, straight-line angle errors: Caused by not having accuracy. Improved through Searching the Line and Repetition.

Errors:

1. A small change in angle that leads to a line being distant from the calculated line. So you should measure the distance from a line, and then look to see if all of the lines preceding it have little to no change in their angles.

There should be some kind of line that's used to describe lines with no angle deviations.

So you need to measure the length of the line and the error it has from being in front.

You need feedback that describes the type of exercise needed to fix the error. By clicking on the error, the student can start an exercise that's designed to reduce making that error.

What kinds of errors are there, and how do you fix them?

How do I create segments between these points?

Feedback From Drawing Straight Lines:
Give people feedback for where they've drawn the line farthest from the calculated line. It should record the line furthest from the

The Reinforcement Learning algorithm needs to figure out what curriculum to give them based on their performance.

So the essential format is that they will practice the main lesson, and then based on their performance, they will get exercises meant to correct the main errors.

Figure out which errors are caused by previous errors.

Markmaking:

1. Line must be drawn quickly enough that you're only focusing on the execution of a planned line.
2.

Interaction:

1. Have the user draw a line at a particular speed.
2. Have them draw it at a particular angle.
3. Have them draw it at a particular length.

Exercise:

1. Draw a line from one point to another.

I want each exercise to be written in Svelte such that I can use CSS to organize which HTML information is highlighted or even shown on screen.

Standard Exercise Svelte Template:

1. For each error, give corrective feedback. Feedback should give the option to demonstrate and give an exercise that the student can do to improve.
2.

Can Svelte import CSS, HTML, and JS files?

You need a way to manipulate the camera so that you can move the scene so that you can draw a line at a particular place at an angle you're comfortable with.
